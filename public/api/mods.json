      "extendedDescription": "Netherite is an amazing feature, but I felt that it was lacking some depth in Vanilla Minecraft, so I created this mod to add netherite features to all current tools. As of now, there are netherite equivalents for the elytra, bow, crossbow, anvil, fishing rod, trident, shulker boxes, horse armor, and shields. Some added features are fake netherite blocks for building, lava fishing with the netherite fishing rod, and xp reduction in the netherite anvil, which never breaks. All of these features are configurable and can be turned on and off. Netherite Plus is available for both Fabric and Forge",
